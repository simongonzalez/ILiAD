App Link to be uploaded on Friday 16th September 2022

This app presents a linguistic corpus from Twitter posts in English, coming from 26 news agencies and 27 individuals. Our main goal was to create a fully annotated English corpus for linguistic analysis. We have included information on morphology and syntax, as well as NLP features such as tokenization, lemmas, and n- grams. We present information through a range of powerful visualisations for users to explore linguistic patterns in the corpus. With this tool, it is pour aim to contribute to the area of language technologies applied to linguistic research.
