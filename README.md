ILiAD: An Interactive Corpus for Linguistic Annotated Data from Twitter Posts

[App Link](https://simon-gonzalez.shinyapps.io/iliad/)

NOTE: The app has been tested on a local version. Please let me know if you encounter issues to be addressed.

This app presents a linguistic corpus from Twitter posts in English, coming from 26 news agencies and 27 individuals. Our main goal was to create a fully annotated English corpus for linguistic analysis. We have included information on morphology and syntax, as well as NLP features such as tokenization, lemmas, and n- grams. We present information through a range of powerful visualisations for users to explore linguistic patterns in the corpus. With this tool, it is pour aim to contribute to the area of language technologies applied to linguistic research.

Since the app was mdeployed with a Free account, there are specific limitations that can affect the app performance:

Up to 25 active hours per month. If it exceeds 25 active hours, users will receive a polite notice that the application is not available and to try again later. The default active continuous time in the app is 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, the app may restart. If there are many users accessing the app at the same time, there may be an overload and the app will not function properly.

Please notify me of any issues (simondariogonzalez@gmail.com - Subject: ILIAD App).
